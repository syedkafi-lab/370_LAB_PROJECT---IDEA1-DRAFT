Smart Career and Internship Management System

PROJECT_OVERVIEW : 

Smart Career and Internship Management System:

SmartMatch aims to automate and personalize the career placement process through a data-driven and interactive approach. It functions as both a career management hub and a networking system, integrating three key dimensions:

I.Smart Resume Database → A searchable database that stores and indexes all student resumes, extracts key skills and experience data, and enables recruiters to find suitable candidates efficiently.
II.Skill-Based Job Matching → An intelligent matching engine compares student skills, CGPA, and academic details with job requirements, generating ranked “Top Matches” for each position.
III.Interactive Networking Platform → A mutual interest system (inspired by Bumble) allows students and recruiters to connect through two-way interest acknowledgments. Once both express interest, the system creates a connection channel for real-time chat and collaboration.
